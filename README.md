# ERCs and EIPs

The Web3 and blockchain ecosystem is fundamentally democratic and open source. As such major blockchains will often implement methods by which the community can submit suggestions for changes in methodologies and standards. These are typically known is `Improvement Proposals`, and in the Ethereum ecosystem they are `Ethereum Improvement proposals` (`EIPs`).

If `EIPs` get enough traction to warrant genuine consideration they will often generate a `Request for Comments`, in Ethereum these are known as `Ethereum Request for Comments` (`ERCs`).

> ❗ **NOTE** > `EIPs` and `ERCs` are numbered chronologically! `ERC20` is the 20th request for comments that was created.

New `Improvement Proposals` and `Requests for Comments` are tracked on websites such as **[eips.ethereum.org](https://eips.ethereum.org/)**, where you can watch these proposals go through the process real time and be adopted or rejected by the community.
